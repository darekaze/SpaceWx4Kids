Ionosphere consists of a combination of electrically charged atoms and molecules, located between 80 and about 600 km altitude. Ionosphere is separated into three main layers, called the D layer, E layer and F layer. These layers' altitude varies from season to season. 

When the Sun's high-energy X-rays and ultraviolet radiation arrive the Earth's atmosphere, they would knock some electrons off the gas molecules there. This ions producing process is called ionization. Ionosphere refers to the regions with higher concentrations of ions and free electrons.
