Ionosphere is a combination of electrically charged atoms and molecules, locating at the altitude of 50-1000km. Ionosphere is separated into three main layers. They are called D layer, E layer and F layer. These layers' altitude varies from season to season. 

When high-energy particles from the Sun arrive the ionosphere, auroras would be generated. (See phenomenon - aurora)
