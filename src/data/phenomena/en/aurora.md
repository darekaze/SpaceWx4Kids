*Aurora in Tromso, Norway<br>(By Mr SHUN Chi-Ming, Director of the Hong Kong Observatory)*

Space weather is not necessarily a bad thing.  It can also create some beautiful phenomena called aurora! The **solar wind** brings **charged particles** (mostly electrons) from the Sun. The electrons follow the Earth’s magnetic field and move down to the **polar regions**, where they collide with **oxygen** and **nitrogen** atoms and molecules in Earth’s upper atmosphere. **Oxygen** gives off **green or red** light while **nitrogen** glows **blue and purple**.

We have the best chance to view aurora at high latitude of about 60 and 75 degrees, for example in northern Europe and Canada. When <a href="#/en/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms">geomagnetic storms</a> occur, the region of aurora expands toward the equator and it may even be seen in lower latitudes!
