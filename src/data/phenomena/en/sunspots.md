# Sunspots

Sunspots are dark areas on the Sun's surface with relatively low temperatures (compared with other parts of the sun) and strong magnetic fields. They normally appear in groups. The number of sunspots is usually taken as an indicator of solar activity. It increases significantly and can reach hundreds at the peak of a solar cycle.

# Solar Cycle

Solar activity is periodic. A solar cycle (also called a sunspot cycle) is an approximately 11-year period with increasing and decreasing sunspot numbers. Each cycle starts from the time of minimum solar activity.
