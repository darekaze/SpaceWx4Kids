# Sunspots

Sunspots are **dark areas** on the Sun's surface with relatively **low temperatures** (compared with other parts of the Sun) and **strong magnetic fields**. They normally appear in groups. The number of sunspots is usually taken as an indicator of solar activity. It increases significantly and can reach hundreds at the peak of a solar cycle.

# Solar Cycle

Solar activity is periodic. A solar cycle (also called a sunspot cycle) is an approximately **11-year** period with **increasing and decreasing sunspot numbers**. Each cycle starts from the time of minimum activity.
