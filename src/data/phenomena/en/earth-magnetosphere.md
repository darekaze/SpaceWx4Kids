# Earth's Magnetosphere

The flow of molten iron in Earth’s core generates electric currents, which in turn produces a **magnetic field**.  Through interaction with the solar wind, this magnetic field forms a shield for Earth known as the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere protects us from the Sun’s **ultraviolet radiation**, as well as energetic particles everywhere in space known as **cosmic radiation**.  Instead of penetrating directly into Earth’s surface, the charged particles hitting the shield (magnetosphere) mostly flow around and get trapped in a region called **radiation belts**. A portion of them follow the magnetic field to move down to the **polar regions**.

The pressure of the solar wind on Earth’s magnetic field compresses the field on the dayside of Earth and stretches the field into a long tail on the nightside.
