# Radiation Belts

In 1958, with the launch of the first U.S. satellite, Earth’s radiation belts were discovered. Radiation belts describe a region of increasing number of **energetic electrons or protons** surrounding the Earth. It is dynamic and will change on time scales of minutes to years. Those energetic electrons or protons may emit radiation to disrupt satellites or affect the Earth’s **ionosphere** and upper atmosphere.
