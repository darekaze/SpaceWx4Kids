## Radiation belt

In 1958, because of the launch of the first US satellite, the Earth’s radiation belt was discovered. Later satellites joined the investigation of radiation belt, trying to figure out the cause of energization, transport and loss of radiation belt particles.

Radiation belt describe a region of increasing number of energetic electrons or protons surrounding the Earth. It is dynamic and will change on time scales of minutes to years. Those energetic electrons or protons may emit radiation to disrupt satellites or affect the Earth’s ionosphere and upper atmosphere.
