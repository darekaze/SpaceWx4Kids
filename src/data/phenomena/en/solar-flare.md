# Solar flare

The Sun has its own magnetic field.  When the magnetic field evolves and the field lines reorganize, it will cause a sudden violent explosion called solar flare. During the occurrence of solar flare, there is a burst of **electromagnetic radiation** from the Sun  lasting from minutes to hours. The electromagnetic emission produced during flares travels at the speed of light and can reach the Earth in about 8 minutes.
