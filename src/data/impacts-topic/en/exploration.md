## Human space exploration

**Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)** release enormous amounts of energetic particles into space which present a health hazard to **astronauts**.  During space missions, astronauts outside spacecraft are more exposed to space radiation.

Astronauts working in space need to wear radiation protective clothing.

The operation of spacecraft can be affected by space weather.

Charged particles from the Sun may cause impacts to the equipment of the spacecraft. For example, **high energy ions** penetrate electronic components and cause errors in **electronic signals**, leading to **improper commands** in the spaceship or **incorrect data** of an instrument.

Moreover, charge accumulation may occur on the electronics on board satellites and spacecraft, resulting in a build-up of the electric field. When an electrical discharge eventually happens, the **electronics may be damaged**, hence affecting the operation of spacecraft.
