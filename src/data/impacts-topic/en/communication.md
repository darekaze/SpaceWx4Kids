Space weather affects communications at all frequencies. **High frequency (HF) radio communications** depend on reflection by the ionosphere to carry signals at great distances. **X-rays** produced by **solar flares** may ionize the atmosphere and enhance the D-layer of the ionosphere, thereby disrupt radio communication and cause **Radio Blackouts**.

**Solar** **radiation storms** produce energetic solar protons which are guided by Earthâ€™s magnetic field and collide with the upper atmosphere near the North and South Poles. These protons may also create an enhanced D-Layer thus **blocking HF radio communication at high latitudes**.
