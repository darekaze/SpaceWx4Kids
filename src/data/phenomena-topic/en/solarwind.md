##Solar Wind

The Sun releases tremendous energy. Solar wind refers to this **released energy** in the form of charged particles at high speed, reaching several hundred kilometres per second. While the **magnetic field** on the Earth (which traps charged particles encircling the Earth into radiation belts called the Van Allen belts) normally protects our planet from the solar wind, it may be deformed in the event of **violent solar wind**, resulting in a **geomagnetic storm** on Earth.![Solar Wind](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PBd-XbQswXZtc_HUMYo8GL8KOBR6p-ojgc8QnXP0wLXsWQSq5k_WoKwmHz24xphDy5MqsvwVEg200Y6s4c1GcQPR_0EETIRtUAaQtluCsYXTq4c6mHkwok0wotLvcp4vomAUEiyP)Illustration of the influence on the Earth's magnetic field when solar wind approaches the Earth.
