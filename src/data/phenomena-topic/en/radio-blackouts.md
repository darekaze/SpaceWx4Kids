Solar flare is a **violent solar activity**. Its occurrence is related to a **sudden burst of electromagnetic waves** and **a vast amount of charged particles** (mostly electrons) from the Sun. These electromagnetic waves can affect telecommunications, radio broadcast and navigation system on Earth. Sometimes, charged particles can also endanger the operations of spacecraft and satellites in space, and expose astronauts to higher amounts of radiation.

**Radio blackouts** refers to intense X-rays with ionizing power upset the Earth's ionosphere, producing signal scintillations (which mean noise, distortion and attenuation) and disrupting radio communication.
