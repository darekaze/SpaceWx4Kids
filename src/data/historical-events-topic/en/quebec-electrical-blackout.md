## 1989: Solar Flare – Quebec Electrical Blackout

In March 1989, a sunspot group which is as large as the sum of the size of 54 Earths caused more than **195 solar flares**. On 10 March, astronomers witnessed a powerful explosion on the sun. Within minutes, tangled magnetic forces on the sun had released a billion-ton cloud of gas. On the evening of 12 March, the vast cloud of solar plasma (a gas of electrically charged particles) finally struck Earth's magnetic field. 

The huge magnetic storm created a **huge electrical power blackout** which covered the entire province of Quebec, Canada.  The power grid to failed in 90 seconds leaving millions **without power for up to 9 hours**.  The blackout also affected education, business and even aviation.  The total cost was estimated at over $2 billion USD.  

In space, some satellites tumbled out of control for several hours. NASA's TDRS-1 communication satellite recorded over 250 anomalies as high-energy particles invaded the satellite's sensitive electronics. Even the Space Shuttle Discovery was having problems on its sensor.

The violent geomagnetic storm caused spectacular and very **long lasting aurora** on 13 March.  The aurora could be observed in Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia and even as far south as Florida and Cuba.

**Power systems** in areas of igneous rock (gray) are the most vulnerable to the effects of intense geomagnetic activity because the high resistance of the igneous rock encourages geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow in the power transmission lines situated above the rock. Shown in cross-hatching are the auroral zone and the extremes that the aurora can reach during severe disturbances such as March 13, 1989.
