## 1859: Carrington Event

A large **solar storm** brought some chaos to the **telegraph system** in 1859. On 1 September that year, English astronomer Richard Carrington observed one very extreme explosion of a group of sunspots through the image projected from his telescope (image below).

This solar flare hurled at Earth a huge cloud of **charged particles** that arrived in just 17 hours and greatly interfered with the geomagnetic field. The resulting fluctuations induced large currents in telegraph wires, and sparks were reported at stations in Paris and Washington DC. Most lines had to be closed in response.

Since the telegraph was practically the only electrical system back then, the impact was relatively limited, but the solar storm itself is in fact one of the most powerful storms on record. Energetic particles from the Sun could trigger a chain of chemical reactions that result in nitrates being deposited onto the Earth's surface and preserved in ice cores, and samples corresponding to 1859 have been analysed to show the highest concentration of the compound in 500 years. The Carrington Event is therefore believed to be the largest over these past centuries, and is often portrayed as the worst-case scenario. If a solar storm of such magnitude were to happen today, the impacts would certainly be much more serious.
