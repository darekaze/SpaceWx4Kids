## 2003: “Halloween” Solar Storm

This solar storm was a massive **X45-class solar storm** which was one of the largest ones of the past half-century.  It began in mid-October 2003 when increased solar activity occurred, then intensified when a coronal mass ejection (CME) left the sun on 28 October.

| Solar flares lassification | Peak flux range at 100–800 picometre (watts/square metre) |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| A              | < $10^{-7}$                                               |
| B              | $10^{-7}$ - $10^{-6}$                                     |
| C              | $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-5}$                                     |
| M              | $10^{-5}$ - $10^{-4}$                                     |
| X              | $10^{-4}$ - $10^{-3}$

The solar storm affected **satellite systems** and **communications**.  The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) failed temporarily. NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite experienced damage, and instruments aboard many spacecraft had to be shut down temporarily.  It also killed the Japanese ADEOS-II. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station were advised to seek shelter from the elevated radiation levels. 

During the solar storm, **airlines** that usually flew over the pole diverted their routes to lower latitudes. It caused transformer failures in South Africa, major **HF radio blackouts**, as well as a major loss of **GPS accuracy**. Airborne magnetic and geophysical surveys were delayed or cancelled. A **maritime mission** had to be cancelled due to communication interference.  The storm also produced **auroras** visible in the subtropics as the resulting solar winds swept around Earth.
