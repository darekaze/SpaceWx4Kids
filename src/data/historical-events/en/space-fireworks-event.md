## 2011: Space Fireworks Event

An unusual and transient fireworks event on the Sun's surface was recorded by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on 7 June 2011.  It was an eruption on the solar surface after the flash of a solar flare.

A shock wave originating from the blast site of the solar flare was also detected. It was like a solar tsunami propagating more than halfway across the Sun.

The blast propelled a significant coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun.  The CME was essentially a magnetized cloud of ionized gas consisting of high speed energetic particles. Since its path of propagation had missed the Earth, there was no adverse space weather affecting the safety of astronauts or operation of artificial satellites, telecommunication systems and terrestrial power supply.
