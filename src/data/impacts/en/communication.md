<a href="#/en/phenomena/solar-flare">Solar flares</a> produce X-rays which may ionize the atmosphere.  This may disrupt radio communication and cause <a href="#/en/phenomena/radio-blackouts">radio blackouts</a>.

<a href="#/en/phenomena/solar-radiation-storms">Solar radiation storms</a> produce energetic charged particles, protons and electrons, which are guided by the Earthâ€™s magnetic field, spiraling down the magnetic field lines at the two poles. This may block High Frequency (HF) radio communication at high latitudes.
