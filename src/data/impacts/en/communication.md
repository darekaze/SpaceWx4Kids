# Communication

Space weather affects communications at all frequencies. **High frequency (HF) radio communications** depend on reflection by the ionosphere to carry signals at great distances. **X-rays** produced by **solar flares** may ionise the atmosphere and enhance the D-layer of the ionosphere, thereby disrupt radio communication and cause **Radio Blackouts**.

**Solar radiation storms** produce energetic charged particles, protons and electrons, which are guided by Earthâ€™s magnetic field, spiraling down the magnetic field lines at the two poles pointing vertically downwards and hence increasing ionization in the upper atmosphere.  The energetic protons may also create an enhanced D-Layer thus **blocking HF radio communication at high latitudes**.
