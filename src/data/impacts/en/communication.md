**Solar flares** produce **X-rays** which may ionize the atmosphere (see Phenomena : Ionosphere).  This may disrupt radio communication and cause **radio blackouts**.

**Solar radiation storms** produce energetic charged particles, protons and electrons, which are guided by the Earthâ€™s magnetic field, spiraling down the magnetic field lines at the two poles. This may **block High Frequency (HF) radio communication at high latitudes**.
