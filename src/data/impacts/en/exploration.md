**Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)** release enormous amounts of energetic particles into space which present a health hazard to **astronauts**, especially when they are working outside the spacecraft.  Besides, charged particles from the sun may cause impacts to the equipment of the spacecraft.

When intense solar activities bring severe **solar winds** towards the Earth, the atmosphere in which satellites travel will increase in density.  This will increase the **drag force** on the movement of these satellites, causing a **slow down** or even **deorbit** of these satellites.

The coronal mass ejection during the **“Halloween” Solar Storm** in 2003 caused damages in a number of satellites.  Moreover, astronauts aboard the International Space Station were advised to seek shelter from the elevated radiation levels.
