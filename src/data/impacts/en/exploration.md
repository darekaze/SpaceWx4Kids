<a href="#/en/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections">Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)</a> release enormous amounts of energetic particles into space which present a health hazard to astronauts, especially when they are working outside the spacecraft.  Besides, charged particles from the Sun may cause impacts to the equipment of the spacecraft.

When intense solar activities bring severe <a href="#/en/phenomena/solarwind">solar winds</a> towards the Earth, the upper atmosphere will increase in density.  This will increase the drag force on the movement of some satellites, causing a slow down or even deorbit of these satellites.
