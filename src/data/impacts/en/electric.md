Large currents in the ionosphere can induce currents in power lines. Surges from these induced currents may result in massive **network failures** and **permanent damage** to electric grid components.

Occurrence of **geomagnetic storms** can induce electric current in oil pipelines and electric cables. Flow meters may be affected, giving **incorrect reading**. The rate of corrosion of pipeline may also increase. The abnormal current induced in power grids may **damage transformers due to overheating**.
