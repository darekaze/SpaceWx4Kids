Large currents in the ionosphere can induce currents in power lines. Surges from these induced currents may result in massive **network failures** and **permanent damage** to electric grid components.

In 1859, English astronomer Richard Carrington observed one very extreme explosion of a group of sunspots from his telescope. This solar flare hurled at Earth a huge cloud of charged particles that arrived in just 17 hours. The resulting fluctuations in the Earthâ€™s magnetic field induced large currents in telegraph wires which resulted in chaos in the telegraph system.

In 1989, a large geomagnetic storm created a huge electrical power blackout for up to 9 hours in Quebec, Canada.
