Maritime and aviation navigation systems use **GPS radio signals** sent from satellites to GPS receivers on the ground which pass through the Earth’s ionosphere to locate vessels or aircraft.  Intense solar activity may disturb the ionosphere which reduces **accuracy in the position information** in these systems.

Changes in the magnetic field associated with **geomagnetic storms** directly affect operations that use the Earth’s magnetic field for guidance, such as **magnetic surveys** and **directional drilling**.
