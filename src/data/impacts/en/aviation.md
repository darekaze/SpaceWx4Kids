Space weather can cause lost or degraded **communications**, unreliable **navigational information** and problems with **flight-critical electronic systems**. Solar energetic particles can increase radiation dosage to crew and passengers on polar route flights.

The radiation exposure of cosmic ray depends on the **annual flight time and routes**. The selection of a flight route with lower latitudes and shorter flight time can reduce the received dose.

For protection of flight crews against cosmic radiation, a reference level in between 5 and 10 mSv per year (less than half of the dose limit for radiation workers which is 20 mSv per year), as suggested by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, is generally selected by airlines for monitoring the radiation dose level of their flight crews. 

Frequent flyers are encouraged to assess their personal exposure using freely available dose calculators (such as SIEVERT website: <https://www.sievert-system.org>) and consider adjustment of the requirements and frequency of their flights.
