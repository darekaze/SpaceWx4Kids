Space weather can cause lost or degraded communications, unreliable navigational information and problems with flight-critical electronic systems. Solar energetic particles can **increase radiation dosage** to crew and passengers on polar route flights.

The radiation exposure to cosmic ray is highly dependent of the annual flight time and routes.  For protection of flight crews against cosmic radiation, a reference level in between 5 and 10 mSv per year (less than half of the dose limit for radiation workers which is 20 mSv per year), as suggested by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP-132, 2016), is generally selected by airlines for monitoring the radiation dose level of their flight crews.

Frequent flyers can assess their personal exposure using freely available dose calculators (such as [SIEVERT](https://www.sievert-system.org)) and consider adjustment of the requirements and frequency of their flights, if needed.
