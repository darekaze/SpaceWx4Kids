When intense solar activities bring severe **solar winds** towards the Earth, the upper atmosphere will increase in temperature and density, and expand to enclose the orbits of some satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). This will increase the **drag force** on the movement of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), causing a **slow down** or even **deorbit** of the satellites.
