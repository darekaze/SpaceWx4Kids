# How to monitor space weather?

Solar phenomena, such as sun spots and solar flares, provide good indications of space weather. In particular, the intensity of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation from the Sun provide valuable information for space weather forecasting.

Space weather can be observed from the ground and from space. On the ground, telescopes and optical instruments are used to record the number of [sunspots](/#/en/phenomena/sunspots), as well as to observe [aurora](/#/en/phenomena/aurora), which provide evidence of geomagnetic storms.

While observation from the ground is affected by Earth's atmosphere and weather, observation from space does not have such a limitation. As such, satellites and spacecraft have been used to monitor the space weather. Some of them are introduced as follows:

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was launched in 1995 to study solar wind and the internal structure of the Sun. It was a cooperation between European Space Agency (ESA) and U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) are operated by the United States. The GOES 12 through 15 (N-P) satellites each carry a sophisticated X-ray telescope called the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) to monitor the Sun’s hot outer atmosphere, or corona. Observations of solar X-rays aids in the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and other phenomena that impact the geospace environment.

The early warning given by the SXI observations comes at least 15 hours before the associated shockwave of the solar eruption arrives at Earth, allowing the space weather forecasters to issue timely watches, warnings and alerts.

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft is a NASA mission which has been observing the Sun since 2010.
