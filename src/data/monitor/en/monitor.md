# Monitor

## How to monitor space weather?

Space weather can be observed from the ground and from space. On the ground, telescopes and optical instruments are used to record the number of [sun spots](#/en/section/phenomena/sunspots), as well as to observe [aurora](#/en/section/phenomena/aurora), which provide evidence of geomagnetic storms.

While observation from the ground is affected by Earth's atmosphere and weather, observation from space does not have such a limitation. As such, satellites and spacecraft have been used to monitor the space weather. 

## Satellite Monitoring

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was launched in 1995 to study solar wind and the internal structure of the Sun. It was a cooperation between European Space Agency (ESA) and U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) are operated by the United States. The GOES 13 through 15 (N-P) satellites each carry a sophisticated X-ray telescope called the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) to monitor the Sun’s hot outer atmosphere, or corona. Observations of solar X-rays aids in the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and other phenomena that impact the geospace environment.

The early warning given by the SXI observations comes at least 15 hours before the associated shockwave of the solar eruption arrives at the Earth, allowing the space weather forecasters to issue timely watches, warnings and alerts.

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft is a NASA mission which has been observing the Sun since 2010.

The Space Environment Monitor (SEM) on China’s Fengyun 3C (FY-3C) satellite, launched in September 2013, can effectively monitor the space environment and the charged particle flux, record impacts of space weather events on the satellite, and provide important data for space weather monitoring and warning.
