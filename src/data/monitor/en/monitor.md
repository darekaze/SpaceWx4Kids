# How to monitor space weather?

Space weather can be observed from the ground and from space. On the ground, telescopes and optical instruments are used to record the number of [sunspots](/#/en/phenomena/sunspots), as well as to observe [aurora](/#/en/phenomena/aurora), which provide evidence of geomagnetic storms.

While observation from the ground is affected by Earth's atmosphere and weather, observation from space does not have such a limitation. As such, satellites and spacecraft have been used to monitor the space weather.
